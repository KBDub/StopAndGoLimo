## 1. Completed Changes

### 1.1 — Search Infrastructure
- **Meilisearch removed entirely.** No binary, no workflow, no env vars.
- `SCOUT_DRIVER` set to `database` in Replit shared env.
- `meilisearch/meilisearch-php` composer package removed.
- `scripts/startup-dev.sh` and `scripts/startup.sh` — Meilisearch start blocks and health gates removed.

- `app/Livewire/Catalog/CollectionPage.php` — rewritten to use Eloquent queries instead of the Meilisearch client.
- `storage/meilisearch/` directory — removed.

### 1.2 — Signal Gold Retired
- Signal Gold (`#FEC42D`, Tailwind token `signal`) removed from the active palette.
- `tailwind.config.js` — `signal` color token removed.
- `resources/css/app.css` — no Signal Gold CSS vars were ever added (was Tailwind-only).
- `resources/views/components/ui/button-signal.blade.php` — now proxies to `button-champagne-solid`.
- Demo page (`/demo`) — Signal Gold removed from palette display, button section updated, banner section updated.
- `docs/branding-requirements.md` — updated to 4+White palette throughout.

### 1.3 — Button System Updates
- `x-ui.button` base component — `radius` prop added (options: `square`, `soft`, `rounded`, `pill`; default: `soft` = 10px).
- `x-ui.button` base component — `size` prop added (options: `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`; default: `md`).
- `x-ui.button-text-champagne` — renamed to `x-ui.button-text-link`.
- Demo page — button section updated to show all current variants and radius options.

## 2. CSS and Tailwind Cleanup (Pending)

The following must be done together — change the token namespace first, then sweep the blade files.

### Step 1 — `tailwind.config.js`

**Remove these legacy Top 5 Pct color tokens:**

| Token | Value | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `sunburst` | `#FFC20E` and shades | Delete |
| `azure` | `#3273DC` and shades | Delete |
| `linen` | `#F2F0E6` and shades | Delete |
| `charcoal` | `#2C2C2C` and shades | Delete |
| `olive` | `#A39822` | Delete |
| `blush-pink` | `#FBCDCE` | Delete |
| `success` | `#4CAF50` | Delete (use `stopngo-success`) |
| `warning` | `#F9A825` | Delete (use `stopngo-warning`) |
| `error` | `#C62828` | Delete (use `stopngo-error`) |
| `muted` | `#69727D` | Rename to `slate` (aligns with CSS var) |

**Remove these legacy gradient tokens:**

| Token | Action |
|---|---|
| `gold-gradient` | Delete |
| `gold-gradient-light` | Delete |
| `gold-gradient-dark` | Delete |

- `sans` font family: change from `['Titillium Web', 'Arial', ...]` to `['Montserrat', 'Arial', ...]`

---

### Step 2 — `resources/css/app.css`

**Remove the entire legacy `:root` block (lines 16-55):**
- `--color-sunburst-*` (light, default, dark)
- `--color-azure-*` (light, default, dark)
- `--color-linen-*` (light, default, dark)
- `--color-charcoal-*` (lighter, light, default, dark)

- `a { @apply text-azure }` and `a:hover { @apply text-azure/80 }` — rewire to champagne

- `.btn-accent` — remove `bg-azure`, replace or delete
- All `.link-*` classes — rewire from azure/sunburst/charcoal to champagne/navy/slate

**Update unlayered styles (lines 360-368):**
- `.link-notification` — change `var(--color-azure)` to `var(--champagne)`

**Update `.card-detail-content` (lines 383-436):**

- `--border-radius-md: 0px` — change to `10px`

## 3. Blade Files with "Top 5 Pct" Text References (Must Rewrite Content)

These files contain literal "Top 5 Pct," "top5pct," or "top5pct.com" strings in their text, URLs, or image paths. Content must be replaced with Stop & Go copy.

### Pages
| File | Type of reference |
|---|---|
| `resources/views/pages/home.blade.php` | JSON-LD `provider`, `areaServed`, FAQs, `ogImage` path |
| `resources/views/pages/service-areas.blade.php` | Section copy, image paths |
| `resources/views/pages/service-areas/show.blade.php` | City copy, image paths, `top5pct` slugs |

### Layout and Global Components
| File | Type of reference |
|---|---|
| `resources/views/components/layouts/page.blade.php` | Default meta title/description |

| `resources/views/sitemaps/sitemap-video.blade.php` | Top 5 Pct video URLs |

### Demo / Partials (Low priority — internal tools)
| File | Notes |
|---|---|

---

## 4. Blade Files with Old Tailwind Color Classes (Must Update After Step 1-2 Above)

These files use `bg-sunburst`, `text-azure`, `bg-linen`, `text-charcoal`, `bg-charcoal`, `text-olive`, etc. They will break visually once the old tokens are removed from `tailwind.config.js`.

### UI Components — Delete Entirely (Old Brand Colors in Name and Code)

|---|---|
| `resources/views/components/ui/banner-thin-linen.blade.php` | Linen = T5P color |

| `resources/views/components/ui/button-charcoal-gold.blade.php` | Charcoal = T5P color |
| `resources/views/components/ui/button-outline-charcoal.blade.php` | Charcoal = T5P color |
| `resources/views/components/ui/button-gold-charcoal.blade.php` | Charcoal = T5P color |
| `resources/views/components/ui/button-gold-gradient.blade.php` | Sunburst gold, T5P |
| `resources/views/components/ui/button-gold-white.blade.php` | Sunburst gold, T5P |
| `resources/views/components/ui/button-outline-gold.blade.php` | Sunburst gold, T5P |

## 5. Section Components to Delete (Top 5 Pct-Specific — No Reuse Value)

These sections exist purely for the print shop business. They have no analog in an airport shuttle service.

| File | Why delete |
|---|---|
| `resources/views/components/sections/top5pct-same-day-service.blade.php` | Brand-named T5P section |
| `resources/views/components/sections/shirt-types-grid.blade.php` | Apparel product grid |

| `resources/views/components/sections/storefront-demo-preview.blade.php` | White-label storefront demo |

---

## 6. UI Components to Delete (E-commerce — No Reuse Value)

The inherited site had a full e-commerce stack. Stop & Go does not sell products online. These components are tied to product listings, cart, and checkout.

| File | Why delete |
|---|---|
| `resources/views/components/ui/carousel-product.blade.php` | Product carousel |
| `resources/views/components/ui/card-product.blade.php` | Product listing card |
| `resources/views/components/ui/card-product-hover.blade.php` | Product hover card |

| `resources/views/components/ui/artwork-dropzone.blade.php` | Artwork upload for print orders |
| `resources/views/components/ui/dtf-dropzone.blade.php` | DTF file upload |
| `resources/views/components/ui/dtf-confirm-modal.blade.php` | DTF confirmation modal |

| `resources/views/components/ui/banner-cta-dtf-dropzone.blade.php` | DTF upload CTA |
| `resources/views/components/ui/banner-full-bleed-2-video.blade.php` | Dual-video banner (T5P) |

## 7. Recommended Cleanup Order

1. `tailwind.config.js` — remove old tokens (Step 1 above)
2. `resources/css/app.css` — clean up vars and layer styles (Step 2 above)
3. Run the app and check for broken styles
4. Delete Section 5 files (T5P-specific sections)
5. Delete Section 6 files (e-commerce UI)
6. Delete old color UI components (Section 4, delete list)
7. Update remaining section and UI components to use new tokens (Section 4, update list)
8. Rewrite page content (Section 3)
9. Update sitemaps last (Section 3, sitemaps)
